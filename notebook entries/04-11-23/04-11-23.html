                Today is Tuesday, April 11, 2023
                <br><br>
                This is my very first notebook entry on this website. I'm so excited! 
                I remember talking to a friend of mine a while back, saying I was 
                considering doing something like this, and now I'm making the time!
                <br><br>
                I plan to make a new page each day. Today is the first page! The purpose 
                of this will be to better organize my code as well as to show visually my growth
                as a web developer. I'm learning HTML (and soon css and js!) right now, I'm new,
                and so this page sucks buttocks. But tomorrow's will be better! And the day after that, 
                even better!
                <br><br>
                And so on.
                <br><br>
                So, today.
                <br><br>
                Low energy (not much sleep). 
                Lots of thinking.
                And I decided to change how I'm living my life. 
                <br><br>
                I decided to take better care of myself, spend more time on things, and 
                be my best self. This was a hard decision, for some reason. It felt like focusing on
                myself would be selfish, and that withdrawing like I have would take me away from the 
                people and the things I love. This feeling still looms over me, to be honest. But I know 
                that for these people and things, I need to be my best self. And this is how I'm doing that.
                <br><br>
                I ate 5 fruits and veggies today!
                <br>
                I went on a lovely night walk!
                <br>
                I did some great breathing exercises!
                <br>
                I took a cold shower!
                <br>
                I did my workout routine!
                <br><br>
                I'm feeling good.
                <br><br>
                I looked like garbage today. And felt like garbage. But with this mood and all of 
                these good changes, I feel like tomorrow's going to be <em>it</em>.
                <br><br>
                Maybe I'll have more time tomorrow to dedicate to this project. I hope so!
                <br><br>
                Take good care, please, reader!
                <br><br>
                And thank you!
                <br><br>
